- Admin sets fee to 5% (500 basis points)
- Fee applies to all future auctions

**Expected Behavior**:
- ✅ Fee successfully updated

#### `test_change_fee_percentage_exceeds_maximum`
**Purpose**: Verify fee cannot exceed 100%.
- Attempt to set fee > 10000 basis points

**Expected Behavior**:
- ✅ Transaction aborts with EInvalidFeePercentage (code 1)

---

### Basic Auction Tests (Unlocked NFTs)

#### `test_create_auction_and_place_bid`
**Purpose**: Verify basic auction creation and bidding flow.

**Flow**:
1. Creator creates auction with unlocked NFT
2. NFT deposited in platform kiosk
3. Bidder places 100 SUI bid
4. Verify bid recorded correctly

**Expected Behavior**:
- ✅ Auction created successfully
- ✅ Highest bid = 100 SUI
- ✅ Highest bidder recorded

#### `test_outbid_with_instant_refund`
**Purpose**: Verify outbid mechanism refunds previous bidder immediately.

**Flow**:
1. Create auction
2. Bidder 1 bids 100 SUI
3. Bidder 2 bids 150 SUI (outbids Bidder 1)
4. Verify Bidder 1 receives instant refund of 100 SUI

**Expected Behavior**:
- ✅ Bidder 2 becomes highest bidder
- ✅ Bidder 1 receives full 100 SUI refund instantly
- ✅ No funds locked in contract

**Key Feature**: This demonstrates the instant refund mechanism that prevents funds from being locked until auction end (unlike some other auction designs).

#### `test_multiple_outbids_with_refunds`
**Purpose**: Verify multiple sequential bids all get refunded correctly.

**Flow**:
1. Create auction
2. Bidder 1: 100 SUI
3. Bidder 2: 200 SUI (Bidder 1 refunded)
4. Bidder 3: 300 SUI (Bidder 2 refunded)

**Expected Behavior**:

- ✅ Final highest bid = 300 SUI (Bidder 3)

---

### Finalization Tests (Unlocked NFTs)

#### `test_finalize_auction_with_fee_deduction`
**Purpose**: Verify auction finalization with fee extraction.

**Setup**:
- Platform fee: 5%
- Winning bid: 100 SUI

**Flow**:
1. Create auction
2. Place winning bid of 100 SUI
3. Wait for expiry
4. Finalize auction

**Expected Behavior**:
- ✅ Creator receives: 95 SUI (100 - 5% fee)
- ✅ Platform collects: 5 SUI fee
- ✅ Winner receives NFT
- ✅ Admin can withdraw 5 SUI fee

**Fee Calculation**: Uses `mul_div_u64` for precise basis point calculation avoiding rounding errors.

#### `test_finalize_auction_with_locked_nft_and_winner`
**Purpose**: Verify full locked NFT auction flow with winner.

**Setup**:
- Platform fee: 5%
- Winning bid: 200 SUI

- ✅ Creator receives: 190 SUI (200 - 10 fee)
- ✅ Platform collects: 10 SUI (5% fee)
- ✅ Winner receives locked NFT
- ✅ Transfer policy respected

**Technical Detail**: Uses list-purchase pattern to extract locked NFT while generating required TransferRequest.

#### `test_finalize_locked_auction_no_bids_returns_to_creator`
**Purpose**: Verify locked NFT returned correctly when no bids.

**Flow**:
1. Create auction with locked NFT
2. Wait for expiry (no bids)
3. Finalize auction

**Expected Behavior**:
- ✅ Locked NFT returned to creator
- ✅ Transfer policy respected during return

3. Bidder 2: 250 SUI (Bidder 1 refunded)
4. Bidder 3: 500 SUI (Bidder 2 refunded)
5. Finalize auction

**Expected Behavior**:
- ✅ All refunds processed instantly
- ✅ Bidder 3 wins and receives NFT
- ✅ Transfer policy enforced

#### `test_mixed_auctions_locked_and_unlocked`
**Purpose**: Verify system handles both locked and unlocked auctions simultaneously.

**Flow**:
1. Create locked NFT auction
2. Place bid and finalize
3. Verify winner receives locked NFT correctly

**Expected Behavior**:
- ✅ Both auction types work independently
- ✅ Correct finalization path chosen for each type

---

### Error Case Tests

#### `test_bid_must_be_higher_than_current`
**Purpose**: Verify bids must exceed current highest bid.

**Flow**:
1. Bidder 1 bids 100 SUI
2. Bidder 2 tries to bid exactly 100 SUI

**Expected Behavior**:
- ✅ Transaction aborts with EBidTooLow (code 3)

#### `test_cannot_bid_on_expired_auction`

### View Function Tests

#### `test_view_functions`
**Purpose**: Verify all getter functions return correct data.

**Tested Functions**:
- `get_creator()` - Returns auction creator address
- `get_expiry_time()` - Returns expiry timestamp
- `is_active()` - Returns auction active status
- `get_highest_bid()` - Returns current highest bid amount
- `get_highest_bidder()` - Returns highest bidder address (Option)
- `get_item_id()` - Returns auctioned NFT ID

**Expected Behavior**:
- ✅ All view functions return correct values

---

### Helper Function Tests

#### `test_create_user_kiosk_helper`
**Purpose**: Verify users can create personal kiosks for auction participation.

**Flow**:
1. User calls `create_user_kiosk_and_transfer()`
2. Verify kiosk created and shared
3. Verify KioskOwnerCap transferred to user

**Expected Behavior**:
- ✅ User receives KioskOwnerCap
- ✅ Kiosk is shared (accessible for auctions)

**Use Case**: Users need personal kiosks to hold NFTs before listing them for auction.

---

## Key Technical Patterns Tested

### 1. Kiosk Integration
- **Unlocked NFTs**: Use `kiosk::place` and `kiosk::take`
- **Locked NFTs**: Use `kiosk::lock` and list-purchase pattern for extraction
- **Platform Kiosk**: Centralized shared kiosk controlled by AuctionHouse via KioskOwnerCap

### 2. Transfer Policy Compliance
- Locked NFTs require TransferPolicy
- Extraction generates TransferRequest
- Must confirm request with `transfer_policy::confirm_request`
- Enables royalty enforcement and custom trading rules

### 3. Instant Refund Mechanism
- Previous bidder refunded immediately when outbid
- Prevents funds from being locked
- Only current highest bid held in auction
- Better UX than traditional escrow patterns

### 4. Fee Collection
- Fees deducted at finalization using `get_fee_from_payment`
- Stored in Bag keyed by coin type
- Admin can withdraw fees per coin type
- Precise basis point calculation (10000 = 100%)

### 5. Time-Based Expiry
- Uses Sui Clock for consistent timestamps
- Enforces bid deadline (bids rejected after expiry)
- Enforces finalization requirement (cannot finalize early)

---

## Error Codes

| Code | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | EAuctionNotExpired | Cannot finalize before expiry time |
| 2 | EAuctionExpired | Cannot bid after auction expired |
| 3 | EBidTooLow | Bid must exceed current highest bid |
| 1 | EInvalidFeePercentage | Fee must be ≤ 10000 (100%) |
