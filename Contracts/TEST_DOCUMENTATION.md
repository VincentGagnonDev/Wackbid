# Test Suite Documentation

## Overview
Comprehensive test suite for the Wackbid Auction System with **100% test pass rate** (12/12 tests passing).

## Test Categories

### 1. Auction House Initialization Tests
- **test_auction_house_initialization**: Verifies proper initialization of AuctionHouse, Kiosk, and AdminCap
- **test_change_fee_percentage**: Tests admin ability to modify platform fees
- **test_change_fee_percentage_exceeds_maximum**: Ensures fees cannot exceed 100% (10000 basis points)

### 2. Auction Creation & Bidding Tests
- **test_create_auction_and_place_bid**: Validates auction creation and first bid placement
- **test_outbid_with_instant_refund**: **CRITICAL TEST** - Verifies instant refund mechanism when outbid
- **test_multiple_outbids_with_refunds**: Tests multiple sequential bids with automatic refunds

### 3. Auction Finalization Tests
- **test_finalize_auction_with_fee_deduction**: **CRITICAL TEST** - Validates:
  - Fee extraction from winning bid
  - Creator receives payment minus fees
  - Winner receives NFT
  - Admin can withdraw collected fees
- **test_finalize_auction_no_bids**: Tests NFT return to creator when no bids placed

### 4. Security & Validation Tests
- **test_bid_must_be_higher_than_current**: Prevents equal/lower bids (prevents bid griefing)
- **test_cannot_bid_on_expired_auction**: Blocks bids after expiry time
- **test_cannot_finalize_before_expiry**: Prevents premature finalization

### 5. View Function Tests
- **test_view_functions**: Validates all getter functions for auction state

## Key Test Scenarios Covered

### Instant Refund Flow ✅
```
Bidder1: 100 SUI → Auction
Bidder2: 150 SUI → Auction
  └─> Bidder1 INSTANTLY receives 100 SUI refund
Bidder3: 200 SUI → Auction
  └─> Bidder2 INSTANTLY receives 150 SUI refund
```

**Assertion**: Previous bidder receives full refund atomically within same transaction

### Fee Deduction Flow ✅
```
Winning Bid: 100 SUI
Platform Fee (5%): 5 SUI → AuctionHouse fee_balance
Creator Payment: 95 SUI → Creator
NFT Transfer: → Winner
Admin Withdrawal: 5 SUI fees → Admin
```

**Assertions**:
- Creator receives exactly 95 SUI (100 - 5% fee)
- Winner receives the NFT
- Admin can withdraw exactly 5 SUI in fees

### No Bids Flow ✅
```
Auction Created → Time Expires → NFT returned to Creator
```

**Assertion**: NFT safely returned when no bids placed

### Time-Based Security ✅
```
Before Expiry: Bids accepted ✓, Finalization blocked ✗
After Expiry: Bids blocked ✗, Finalization allowed ✓
```

**Assertions**:
- Clock timestamp validation prevents expired auction manipulation
- Non-expired auctions cannot be finalized

### Bid Validation ✅
```
Current Bid: 100 SUI
New Bid: 100 SUI → REJECTED (EBidTooLow)
New Bid: 150 SUI → ACCEPTED ✓
```

**Assertion**: Strict greater-than validation prevents gaming

## Test Infrastructure

### Test Helpers
- `setup_auction_house()`: Initializes AuctionHouse, Kiosk, and shared Clock
- `create_test_nft()`: Creates test NFT objects
- `take_shared<T>()`: Helper for accessing shared objects in tests

### Test Addresses
- `ADMIN (@0xAD)`: Platform administrator
- `CREATOR (@0xC1)`: Auction creator
- `BIDDER1 (@0xB1)`: First bidder
- `BIDDER2 (@0xB2)`: Second bidder
- `BIDDER3 (@0xB3)`: Third bidder

### Test NFT Structure
```move
public struct TestNFT has key, store {
    id: UID,
    name: vector<u8>,
}
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
sui move test

# Run with verbose output
sui move test --verbose

# Run specific test
sui move test test_outbid_with_instant_refund
```

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Test Functions | 12 |
| Test Pass Rate | 100% |
| Critical Flows Tested | 5 |
| Security Tests | 3 |
| Edge Case Tests | 4 |
| Test Code Lines | ~700 |

## Continuous Testing

All tests use Sui's `test_scenario` framework for:
- Transaction simulation
- Multi-address interaction testing
- Shared object testing
- Clock manipulation for time-based testing

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Gas Benchmarking**: Measure gas costs for each operation
2. **Load Testing**: Test with large number of simultaneous auctions
3. **Integration Tests**: Test with real transfer policies and royalty rules
4. **Fuzz Testing**: Random input generation for edge case discovery
5. **Invariant Testing**: Property-based testing for system invariants

## Conclusion

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of all auction system functionality with particular emphasis on the critical instant refund and fee deduction mechanisms. All security validations are tested and passing, making the system production-ready from a testing perspective.
