## 🔥 MUST DO: Redeploy Smart Contract

**YES, you MUST redeploy** because we added new functions to the smart contract!

### Step 1: Deploy Contract

```bash
cd C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Wackbid\Contracts
sui move build
sui client publish --gas-budget 200000000
```

### Step 2: Save These IDs

From the deployment output, save:
- ✅ **Package ID**
- ✅ **AuctionHouse ID** (look for `AuctionHouse` object)
- ✅ **Platform Kiosk ID** (look for `Kiosk` object)

### Step 3: Update Frontend .env

```bash
cd C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Wackbid\Frontend

# Edit .env file:
VITE_PACKAGE_ID=0xYOUR_NEW_PACKAGE_ID
VITE_AUCTION_HOUSE_ID=0xYOUR_NEW_AUCTION_HOUSE_ID
VITE_PLATFORM_KIOSK_ID=0xYOUR_NEW_PLATFORM_KIOSK_ID
```

## 🐛 Vite Installation Issue

There's a node_modules issue preventing vite from running. Here's how to fix it:

### Option A: Delete node_modules and use npm (Recommended)

```bash
cd C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Wackbid\Frontend

# Delete everything
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item yarn.lock
Remove-Item package-lock.json

# Use npm instead
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

### Option B: Fix yarn installation

```bash
cd C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Wackbid\Frontend

# Add each missing package explicitly
yarn add -D vite@4.5.14
yarn add -D @vitejs/plugin-react@4.7.0  
yarn add -D tailwindcss@3.3.5
yarn add -D autoprefixer@10.4.16
yarn add -D postcss@8.4.31

# Then try
yarn dev
```

### Option C: Use npx directly (Quick fix)

```bash
cd C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Wackbid\Frontend

# Just run vite with npx (it will download if needed)
npx vite
```

## 🎯 How the Kiosk Feature Works

Once the dev server is running, here's what happens:

### When Winner Finalizes Auction

```typescript
1. Winner clicks "Claim NFT"
2. System checks: getUserKiosk(winner.address)
3. If winner has kiosk:
   → Calls finalize_to_kiosk
   → NFT goes to winner's kiosk ✅
   → Winner can immediately re-auction!
4. If winner has NO kiosk:
   → Calls finalize_to_wallet
   → NFT goes to winner's wallet
   → Still works fine!
```

### Console Logs to Watch

Open browser console (F12) and look for:
- `"Winner is finalizing - checking for kiosk..."`
- `"✅ Winner has kiosk - using finalize_to_kiosk"`
- `"⚠️ Winner has no kiosk - using finalize_to_wallet"`
- `"Auction finalized successfully"`

## 🎉 What You'll Have

### Before This Update
```
Auction → Bid → Finalize
            ↓
        NFT to wallet only
            ↓
        Can't re-auction immediately
```

### After This Update  
```
Auction → Bid → Finalize (Winner)
            ↓
        Has kiosk?
        YES → NFT to kiosk ✅
              Can re-auction NOW!
        NO  → NFT to wallet
              Can auction later
```

## 🔍 Files Changed

### Smart Contract
- `sources/auction.move` - 3 new finalize functions

### Frontend
- `src/lib/sui-transactions.ts` - 3 new functions
- `src/components/auctions/AuctionCard.tsx` - Smart finalization logic
- `package.json` - Added @mysten/kiosk

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Package IDs Will Change
When you redeploy, ALL IDs change. Update `.env` with:
- New Package ID
- New AuctionHouse ID  
- New Platform Kiosk ID

### Old Auctions Won't Work
Auctions created with old contract won't work with new frontend. This is normal for redeployment.

### Kiosk Detection is Automatic
Users don't need to do anything! The system automatically:
- Detects if winner has kiosk
- Uses best finalization method
- Falls back gracefully if needed

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (After Fixing Vite)

```bash
# 1. Deploy contract
cd Contracts
sui move build
sui client publish --gas-budget 200000000

# 2. Update .env (with new IDs from step 1)
cd ../Frontend
# Edit .env file

# 3. Start dev server  
npm run dev  # or yarn dev

# 4. Open browser
# Go to http://localhost:5173 or 5174

# 5. Test!
# Create auction → Bid → Wait → Finalize → Check console logs!
```
