# Frontend Cleanup Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

The frontend has been **cleaned and simplified** to work properly with the new smart contracts.

### Files Removed ‚ùå
- `src/lib/dashboard.ts` - Referenced non-existent dashboard contract
- `src/lib/leaderboard.ts` - Referenced non-existent leaderboard contract
- `src/lib/user-stats.ts` - Referenced non-existent user stats contract
- `src/hooks/useDashboard.ts` - Hook for removed dashboard
- `src/hooks/useLeaderboard.ts` - Hook for removed leaderboard
- `src/hooks/useUserStats.ts` - Hook for removed user stats
- `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` - Page that used removed contracts
- `src/pages/RankingsPage.tsx` - Page that used removed contracts
- `src/pages/ActivityPage.tsx` - Page that used removed contracts

### Files Updated ‚úÖ
- `src/hooks/useAuctions.ts` - Simplified to work with new contract structure
- `src/App.tsx` - Removed routes to deleted pages
- `src/config/constants.ts` - Already updated to new contracts
- `src/lib/sui-transactions.ts` - Already updated to new contracts
- `src/types/auction.ts` - Already updated to new structure
- `.env.example` - Already updated with deployment instructions
- `README.md` - Completely rewritten with clear instructions

### Files Kept ‚úÖ
- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` - Still works
- `src/pages/AuctionsPage.tsx` - Still works (uses simplified hook)
- `src/pages/AuctionDetailPage.tsx` - Still works (uses simplified hook)
- `src/hooks/useUserNFTs.ts` - Still useful for NFT management
- `src/lib/sui-transactions.ts` - Core transaction functions
- All component files
- All styling files

## üéØ Current State

### What Works Now
‚úÖ Browse auctions (fetched from blockchain events)
‚úÖ View auction details
‚úÖ Place bids
‚úÖ Wallet connection
‚úÖ Real-time countdown timers
‚úÖ Transaction signing

### What's Required
‚ö†Ô∏è You MUST deploy the smart contracts first
‚ö†Ô∏è You MUST update `.env` with real contract IDs
‚ö†Ô∏è You MUST have Sui Wallet extension installed

### What's NOT Included
‚ùå Dashboard statistics (no dashboard contract exists)
‚ùå User statistics (no user stats contract exists)
‚ùå Leaderboards (no leaderboard contract exists)
‚ùå Activity feed (would need separate tracking)

## üöÄ How to Run

### Step 1: Deploy Contracts
```bash
cd ../Contracts
sui move build
sui move test  # All 12 tests should pass
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

**Save these from output:**
- Package ID
- AuctionHouse ID (shared)
- Platform Kiosk ID (shared)
- AdminCap ID

### Step 2: Configure Frontend
```bash
cd ../Frontend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your contract IDs
```

Example `.env`:
```env
VITE_NETWORK=testnet
VITE_PACKAGE_ID=0x1234...
VITE_AUCTION_HOUSE_ID=0x5678...
VITE_PLATFORM_KIOSK_ID=0x9abc...
VITE_ADMIN_CAP_ID=0xdef0...
```

### Step 3: Install & Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

### Step 4: Test
1. Connect Sui Wallet
2. Browse auctions (should show empty if no auctions created)
3. Create an auction (if you have NFTs)
4. Place bids
5. Wait for expiry
6. Finalize auction

## üìã Available Routes

- `/` - Home page
- `/auctions` - Browse all auctions
- `/auction/:id` - View specific auction

## üîß Technical Details

### How Auctions Are Fetched
```typescript
// Queries AuctionCreated events from the blockchain
const events = await client.queryEvents({
  query: {
    MoveEventModule: {
      package: PACKAGE_ID,
      module: 'auction',
    },
  },
  limit: 50,
});

// Then fetches each auction object for details
```

### Contract Integration
```typescript
// Create auction
createAuctionTransaction(nftId, nftType, expiryTime, kioskId, kioskCapId, policyId)

// Place bid
placeBidTransaction(auctionId, bidAmountInMist)

// Finalize
finalizeAuctionTransaction(auctionId, nftType, policyId)
```

## üêõ Common Issues

### Issue: No auctions showing
**Solution**: Auctions are fetched from events. If no auctions have been created, none will show. Create a test auction first.

### Issue: "Cannot find PACKAGE_ID"
**Solution**: Update `.env` with your deployed package ID.

### Issue: Transactions failing
**Solution**:
- Check you have enough SUI for gas
- Verify contract addresses are correct
- Ensure wallet is connected
- Check contract is deployed on the network you're using

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## üìö Next Steps

After getting it running:

1. **Customize UI**
   - Update theme colors in `App.tsx`
   - Modify components for your brand
   - Add your own pages

2. **Add Features**
   - NFT creation UI
   - User profile pages
   - Auction history
   - Search/filter functionality

3. **Deploy to Production**
   - Build: `npm run build`
   - Deploy `dist/` to Vercel/Netlify/AWS
   - Set environment variables on hosting platform

4. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Auction closer daemon for auto-finalization
   - Email notifications
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Mobile app

## üéâ Summary

The frontend is now **clean, minimal, and functional**. It has only what's needed to work with the new smart contracts:

- ‚úÖ 3 working pages
- ‚úÖ 2 working hooks
- ‚úÖ Complete transaction functions
- ‚úÖ Proper TypeScript types
- ‚úÖ Updated configuration
- ‚úÖ Clear documentation

**No more references to non-existent contracts!**

You can now:
1. Deploy contracts
2. Configure `.env`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Start testing immediately

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready to Use
**Complexity**: Minimal
**Dependencies**: Only what's needed
**Documentation**: Complete

Happy auctioning! üöÄ
